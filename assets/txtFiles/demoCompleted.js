You've completed the December 2020 playable demo of this thing I'm making!\\n
\\n
Thanks so much for giving it a try and making it this far!\\n
\\n
There's tons more in the works, and I'll make sure to fill you in when the project hits another milestone, but you may be able to find some experimental features in the "00CE6._x172" directory.\\n

If you have any questions, feedback, or bugs to report, please email me.\\n

Thanks again, and I hope you had fun,\\n
