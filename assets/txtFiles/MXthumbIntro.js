 --- notes for moleSeed distribution v.0.14.126 --- \\n
 \\n
\\t panmi wrote the welcome page, and then hard coded it into the kernel, and now I can't edit it, which is really a bummer, because there's some stuff on there which is a bit misleading.
\\n \\t first, just know that moleSeed is designed to take advantage of a widespread security oversight in modern software. As such, there's a good chunk of humanity who considers it malware. That's on you.
\\n \\t second, it's not like this thing is actually running on your toaster, or wherever you spun it up from, it runs on other people's hardware, without their consent. That's also a federal crime, and that's also on you.
\\n \\t Now that's out of the way, I've linked every new instance of moleSeed with Caravan, which is like a server system, but migratory. Like moleSeed, it lives on other people's hardware, and moves around. Everything's read only, so touch anything you want.
