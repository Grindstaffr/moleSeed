 --- notes for moleSeed distribution v.6.0.01--- \\n
 \\n
\\t panmi wrote the welcome page, and then had KETL hard code it into the BIOS splice, and now I can't edit it, which is really a bummer, because there's some stuff on there which is a bit misleading.
\\n \\t first, just know that moleSeed is designed to take advantage of a widespread security oversight in modern software. As such, there's a good chunk of humanity who considers it malware. That's on you.
\\n \\t second, it's not like this thing is actually running on your toaster, or wherever you spun it up from, it runs on other people's hardware, without their consent. That's also a federal crime, and that's also on you.
\\n \\t Now that's out of the way, I've bundled every new instance of moleSeed with nomad.mole. nomad.mole is a user-friendly bit of mole-ware I wrote to link you with the caravan nodenet, which is like a server system, but migratory. Like moleSeed, it lives on other people's hardware, and moves around.
\\n \\t Because each distribution of moleSeed needs to be small, extensions and add-ons are stored in caravan to be installed or grabbed modularly. You should find a node titled unique_key which will have a password you can use to access a small repository we give to each new user. Don't leave without it.
