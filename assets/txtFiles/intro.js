\\n\\t Welcome, and thank you for running moleSeed.
\\n\\t moleSeed is a low-level low-requirement crawler, viewport, and operating system
 designed to run on any machine. moleSeed is light enough to run on the chipset in
 a lightbulb, powerful enough to crack into a 4M databank, and dark enough to remain
 undetected on C.I.D. implants.
\\n\\t We have worked as hard as possible to limit the hardware requirements, building 
from the ground up to build a lean 0-dependecy program that you don't need modern 
hardware to run. 
We believe that access to computers shouldn't be limited by your ability to afford NerveTech. 
If you have a screen and a keyboard, you can boot moleSeed on a toaster.
\\n\\t moleSeed is open source and free to use. We believe in sharing this useful tool 
freely, but since we refuse to charge, we lack the resources of major software developing firms. 
The moleSeed team is small, and the project is early in development. We are working hard to improve 
moleSeed, adding new features whenever we can; but we have limited time, and you may run into bugs.
\\n\\t We are so pleased that moleSeed has ended up in your hands. If you know anyone else who might 
benefit from this resource, please pass it on. Thank you,
\\n
\\n\\t The moleSeed team,
\\n\\t\\t system_ludd, MXthumb, panmi, & KETL9`
