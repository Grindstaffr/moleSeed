KETL9 seems to kinda slink away during these conversations, almost as if they used to work for them or something. Wouldn't surprise me, given all the Gen 2 Impulse Intercept connectors that KETL's got implanted. Gets strung up like a marionette everytime they stream some cleanspace platform. 
	\\n \\t system_ludd has a theory that KETL is affiliated with something called SWARM/phoenix., although ludd can't really explain what that is. Everytime I hear about it, the descriptions of SWARM/phoenix don't really get much further than a vauge notion of some kind of digital boogeyman.
