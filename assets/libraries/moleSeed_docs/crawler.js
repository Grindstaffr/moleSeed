	\\n 
	\\t crawler.mse is a moleSeed executable that acts as a visualizer for node navigating while using the moleSeed terminal. 
\\n \\t After installing crawler.mse, you should be able to use the term "crawl" directly from the terminal in order to execute "crawler.mse." "crawl" acts as a simple shortcut for "ex crawler.mse".
\\n \\t While executing, crawler.mse enables the use of the "inspect" term, which takes a node as an argument. "inspect" will display viable commands for a given node.
Note, however, that crawler.mse does not support nearly as many commands as the moleSeed terminal does, and as such, will likely not list all available commands for a given node. `
